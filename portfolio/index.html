        <h2>About Me</h2>
           <p>  Hello! I'm a motivated front-end web development learner currently enhancing my skills through ALX, 
            building on a foundation of professional and technical skills from a recent 8-week ALX course. 
            With this solid grounding in Google Workspace, leadership, and time management, 
            I am now focused on web technologies that bring websites and applications to life.
            <br> <br>
            In addition to my work with ALX, I’m a 3rd-year Computer Science student at Hawassa University,
             where I’m deepening my understanding of programming and technology. 
             I have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
             and I'm constantly working to improve and expand my knowledge of modern front-end tools and frameworks. 
             I aim to create responsive, accessible, and visually engaging user interfaces that improve user experience across devices.
            <br><br>
            Beyond technical skills, my background includes effective communication and teamwork,
            skills that I know are essential for collaborative projects. 
            I’m driven to stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies, 
            bringing a blend of discipline, creativity, and adaptability to every project I tackle. 
            I’m excited to pursue a career in front-end development where 
            I can contribute to building impactful digital experiences.
            </p>
